# Langton's Ant...IN SPACE!

Check out the [demo](https://realyze.github.io/1718/index.html).

[Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) is a universal Turing machine with very simple rules but surprisingly complex emergent behaviour.

Basic Langton's ant:
 * is an ant that explores a sheet of paper
 * always goes straigt for one second, then turns left...
 * ...unless it crosses it's own path in which case it turns right instead of left

The interesting thing is that after around 10,000 steps, the ant starts building a "highway" pattern of 104 steps which it repeats to infinity.

Now, the common ant is flat. This one lives in 3D. So it's an ant...IN SPACE!
