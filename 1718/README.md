Langton's Ant in 3D

Check out the [demo](https://realyze.github.io/1718/index.html).

[Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) is a universal Turing machine with very simple rules but surprisingly complex emergent behaviour.

Or in other words, the ant can draw surprisingly complex pictures even though its rules are so simple.

The common ant is 2D flat. This one lives in 3D.

# Warning
Contains hacks and sad failed attempt to use basic linear algebra. You must be at least this tall to look at the source code.
